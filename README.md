# notion-enhancer-app.asar
Since Notion-enhanced is not updated anymore, and so i dont have to do the process each time i am on a new linux machine, here is the app.asar that makes notion-enhanced to work.

# How-to

### Install notion-enhancend 

```terminal
$ sudo pacman -S notion-app-enhanced
```

```  
And then extract the file:

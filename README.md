# notion-enhancer-app.asar
Since Notion-enhanced is not updated anymore, and so i dont have to do the process each time i am on a new linux machine, here is the app.asar that makes notion-enhanced to work.

# How-to

### Install notion-enhancend 

```terminal
foo@bar:~$ sudo pacman -S notion-app-enhanced
foo
```

### Go to notion directory
Normally is on /opt/notion/ or in my case  /opt/Notion\ Enhanced/
```terminal
foo@bar:~$ cd /opt/notion or cd /opt/Notion\ Enhanced/
foo
```


app.asar fixed after notion-enhanced v2.0.18.1
